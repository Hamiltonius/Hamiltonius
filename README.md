# 🛠️ Tinkering, Learning, and Building
Welcome, I’m **Hamiltonius**, a hobbyist and lifelong tinkerer exploring tech, automation, and security since the mid 90's. While my **expertise** is in **compliance, economics, export controls, and government FAR 15/12 contracting**, my **foundation** is built on hands-on learning—tinkering with everything from data pipelines to network security.

I believe **broad knowledge builds better specialists**, and I apply this philosophy across my projects. Whether it’s **automating compliance workflows, analyzing market restrictions, or testing security tools**, I take a **practical, hands-on** approach _**—iteration and improvement above all.**_

🖥️ Lesson of the Month: How Export Controls Reshape Innovation


Each month, I’ll highlight a quick tech lesson, troubleshooting tip, or concept breakdown that I’ve learned and found useful.

📌 This Month's Topic: Export Controls & the Innovation Paradox

U.S. export controls aim to slow China's semiconductor development, but an unintended consequence is the acceleration of domestic innovation. With funding from the Big Fund 3.0, China has aggressively invested in AI and semiconductor manufacturing, rapidly advancing 7nm chip production without EUV lithography. While restrictions limit access to cutting-edge Western tech, they also force adaptation—reshaping global supply chains and pushing China toward self-sufficiency.


🔍 Takeaway:
Export controls don’t just restrict technology; they also redirect innovation, creating unpredictable shifts in global competition.
