# 🛠️ Tinkering, Learning, and Building
Welcome, I’m **Hamiltonius**, a hobbyist and lifelong tinkerer exploring tech, automation, and security since the mid 90's. While my **expertise** is in **compliance, economics, export controls, and government FAR 15/12 contracting**, my **foundation** is built on hands-on learning—tinkering with everything from data pipelines to network security.

I believe **broad knowledge builds better specialists**, and I apply this philosophy across my projects. Whether it’s **automating compliance workflows, analyzing market restrictions, or testing security tools**, I take a **practical, hands-on** approach _**—iteration and improvement above all.**_
