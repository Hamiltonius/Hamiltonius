# 🛠️ Tinkering, Learning, and Building
Welcome, I’m **Hamiltonius**, a hobbyist and lifelong tinkerer exploring tech, automation, and security since the mid 90's. While my **expertise** is in **compliance, economics, export controls, and government FAR 15/12 contracting**, my **foundation** is built on hands-on learning—tinkering with everything from data pipelines to network security.

I believe **broad knowledge builds better specialists**, and I apply this philosophy across my projects. Whether it’s **automating compliance workflows, analyzing market restrictions, or testing security tools**, I take a **practical, hands-on** approach _**—iteration and improvement above all.**_

🖥️ Lesson of the Month: Gmail API Authentication & the Power of Scoped Access

Modern automation can begin with a simple question: “I wonder if I can build a pipeline to my email”, at least thats how it was for me!

The Gmail API makes that possible — safely — using OAuth 2.0 and scoped authorization.
Instead of sharing passwords or enabling risky IMAP access, OAuth issues a temporary token after you approve the app. That token grants only what’s requested (e.g., “read-only” access to Gmail). This scoped design keeps credentials safe while allowing automation to handle high-volume inbox tasks — like retrieving attachments, filing messages, or building structured data pipelines.

🔐 Takeaway:
OAuth turns authentication from an all-or-nothing model into a precision tool — empowering secure automation without compromising privacy or control.
